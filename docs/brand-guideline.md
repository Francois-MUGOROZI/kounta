# **Brand Design Guidelines: Kounta**

### **1\. Brand Philosophy**

The **Kounta** brand is built on a foundation of **sophistication, growth, and
reassurance.** Our visual identity is designed to be unique and memorable,
standing apart from the generic "tech blue" aesthetic. We use a palette of deep
green and warm amber to evoke feelings of stability, wealth, and positive
financial outcomes. The overall feel should be clean, professional, and
trustworthy, giving users confidence in the platform that manages their
financial lives.

### **2\. Brand Name**

- **Name:** **Kounta**
- **Rationale:** A modern, stylized spelling of "counter," directly linking the
  brand to the core functions of counting, accounting, and managing money. The
  unique spelling makes it memorable and easy to brand. The leading "K" can also
  serve as a subtle nod to its origins in Kigali.

### **3\. Color Palette**

Our palette is based on Google's Material Design system for consistency and
usability. The primary color is a deep, stable green, associated with growth.
The secondary color is a warm, valuable amber, used for highlights and
calls-to-action.
